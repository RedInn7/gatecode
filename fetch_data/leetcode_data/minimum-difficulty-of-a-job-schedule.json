  "content": "<p>You want to schedule a list of jobs in <code>d</code> days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> job, you have to finish all the jobs <code>j</code> where <code>0 &lt;= j &lt; i</code>).</p>\n\n<p>You have to finish <strong>at least</strong> one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the <code>d</code> days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day.</p>\n\n<p>You are given an integer array <code>jobDifficulty</code> and an integer <code>d</code>. The difficulty of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> job is <code>jobDifficulty[i]</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the minimum difficulty of a job schedule</em>. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return <code>-1</code>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/16/untitled.png\" style=\"width: 365px; height: 370px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2\n<strong>Output:</strong> 7\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.\nSecond day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.\nThe difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7 \n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4\n<strong>Output:</strong> -1\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> If you finish a job per day you will still have a free day. you cannot find a schedule for the given jobs.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 3:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3\n<strong>Output:</strong> 3\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The schedule is one job per day. total difficulty will be 3.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= jobDifficulty.length &lt;= 300</code></li>\n\t<li><code>0 &lt;= jobDifficulty[i] &lt;= 1000</code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= d &lt;= 10</code></li>\n</ul>\n",
