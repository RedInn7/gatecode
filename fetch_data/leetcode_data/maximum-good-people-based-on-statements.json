  "content": "<p>There are two types of persons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The <strong>good person</strong>: The person who always tells the truth.</li>\n\t<li>The <strong>bad person</strong>: The person who might tell the truth and might lie.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> 2D integer array <code>statements</code> of size <code>n x n</code> that represents the statements made by <code>n</code> people about each other. More specifically, <code>statements[i][j]</code> could be one of the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>0</code> which represents a statement made by person <code>i</code> that person <code>j</code> is a <strong>bad</strong> person.</li>\n\t<li><code>1</code> which represents a statement made by person <code>i</code> that person <code>j</code> is a <strong>good</strong> person.</li>\n\t<li><code>2</code> represents that <strong>no statement</strong> is made by person <code>i</code> about person <code>j</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Additionally, no person ever makes a statement about themselves. Formally, we have that <code>statements[i][i] = 2</code> for all <code>0 &lt;= i &lt; n</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of people who can be <strong>good</strong> based on the statements made by the </em><code>n</code><em> people</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/01/15/logic1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 262px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> statements = [[2,1,2],[1,2,2],[2,0,2]]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 2\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Each person makes a single statement.\n- Person 0 states that person 1 is good.\n- Person 1 states that person 0 is good.\n- Person 2 states that person 1 is bad.\nLet&#39;s take person 2 as the key.\n- Assuming that person 2 is a good person:\n    - Based on the statement made by person 2, person 1 is a bad person.\n    - Now we know for sure that person 1 is bad and person 2 is good.\n    - Based on the statement made by person 1, and since person 1 is bad, they could be:\n        - telling the truth.
