The people who are &quot;it&quot; want to catch as many people as possible who are not &quot;it&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>team</code> containing only zeros (denoting people who are <strong>not</strong> &quot;it&quot;) and ones (denoting people who are &quot;it&quot;), and an integer <code>dist</code>.
