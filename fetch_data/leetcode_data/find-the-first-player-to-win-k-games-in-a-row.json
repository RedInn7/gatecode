  "content": "<p>A competition consists of <code>n</code> players numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>.</p>\n\n<p>You are given an integer array <code>skills</code> of size <code>n</code> and a <strong>positive</strong> integer <code>k</code>, where <code>skills[i]</code> is the skill level of player <code>i</code>. All integers in <code>skills</code> are <strong>unique</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>All players are standing in a queue in order from player <code>0</code> to player <code>n - 1</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The competition process is as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The first two players in the queue play a game, and the player with the <strong>higher</strong> skill level wins.</li>\n\t<li>After the game, the winner stays at the beginning of the queue, and the loser goes to the end of it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The winner of the competition is the <strong>first</strong> player who wins <code>k</code> games <strong>in a row</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Return the initial index of the <em>winning</em> player.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"example-block\">\n<p><strong>Input:</strong> <span class=\"example-io\">skills = [4,2,6,3,9], k = 2</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Output:</strong> 2</p>\n\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Initially, the queue of players is <code>[0,1,2,3,4]</code>.
