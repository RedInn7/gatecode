  "content": "<p>You are given a <code>m x n</code> <strong>0-indexed </strong>2D<strong> </strong>matrix <code>mat</code>. From every cell, you can create numbers in the following way:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>There could be at most <code>8</code> paths from the cells namely: east, south-east, south, south-west, west, north-west, north, and north-east.</li>\n\t<li>Select a path from them and append digits in this path to the number being formed by traveling in this direction.</li>\n\t<li>Note that numbers are generated at every step, for example, if the digits along the path are <code>1, 9, 1</code>, then there will be three numbers generated along the way: <code>1, 19, 191</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Return <em>the most frequent <span data-keyword=\"prime-number\">prime number</span> <strong>greater</strong> than </em><code>10</code><em> out of all the numbers created by traversing the matrix or </em><code>-1</code><em> if no such prime number exists. If there are multiple prime numbers with the highest frequency, then return the <b>largest</b> among them.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is invalid to change the direction during the move.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/02/15/south\" style=\"width: 641px; height: 291px;\" /> </strong>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>\nInput:</strong> mat = [[1,1],[9,9],[1,1]]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 19\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> \nFrom cell (0,0) there are 3 possible directions and the numbers greater than 10 which can be created in those directions are:\nEast: [11], South-East: [19], South: [19,191].\nNumbers greater than 10 created from the cell (0,1) in all possible directions are: [19,191,19,11].\nNumbers greater than 10 created from the cell (1,0) in all possible directions are: [99,91,91,91,91].\nNumbers greater than 10 created from the cell (1,1) in all possible directions are: [91,91,99,91,91].\nNumbers greater than 10 created from the cell (2,0) in all possible directions are: [11,19,191,19].\nNumbers greater than 10 created from the cell (2,1) in all possible directions are: [11,19,19,191].\nThe most frequent prime number among all the created numbers is 19.</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> mat = [[7]]\n<strong>Output:</strong> -1\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The only number which can be formed is 7.
